# Basic Stock Tracker for Truckbase Interview

Basic stock tracker built by Kai Schniedergers for the Truckbase interview process.

## Installation
This is a monorepo with 2 packages, frontend and server. They both run in the foreground so you will need 2 terminal windows.

Terminal 1:
`cd server`
`pnpm install`
`pnpm start`

Terminal 2:
`cd frontend`
`pnpm install`
`pnpm start`

## Notes
Theres a lot of random files created by the vite script, etc, the main code I wrote is in `server/src` and `frontend/src/App.tsx`.
